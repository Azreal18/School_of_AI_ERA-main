### Analysis of Iteration 6

---

**Target:**
1. Improve model accuracy to achieve a stable test accuracy of over 99.4%.
2. Add Global Average Pooling (GAP) to remove the last layer.

**Results:**
1. Parameters: 5,328.
2. Best Train Accuracy: 99.19% (last epoch).
3. Best Test Accuracy: 99.22% (last epoch).
4. Difference: No overfitting observed.
5. Epochs: 15.

**Analysis:**
1. The model's test accuracy is currently plateaued at around 99.20% and requires further improvement, potentially through the implementation of data augmentation techniques.
