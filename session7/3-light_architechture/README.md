### Analysis of Iteration 3
---

**Target:**
1.   The goal is to train the model with fewer iterations and reduce the complexity of the architecture by reducing the number of trainable parameters.


**Results:**
1.   Total Parameters: 10,546
2.   Best Training Accuracy: 98.99% (15th epoch)
3.   Best Test Accuracy: 98.84% (15th epoch)
4.   Difference: Slight overfitting observed due to higher training accuracy
5.   Epochs: 15


**Analysis:**
1.   The model appears to be slightly overfit.
2.   The overall architecture is simple and can be further improved to achieve better accuracy and mitigate overfitting.
